### (Submission for UofTHacks2018)

> Know what you eat

Our project allows users to set their dietary restrictions, whether that may be allergies, ingredients they prefer not to eat, or lifestyle choices such as "vegetarian", or even "halal" food. We even have support to look up diets the user can take on and add to their lifestyle.



### Synopsis

This project is an application based on Google Action and Dialogue Flow to provide users with an easy-to-use interface to store and manage their dietary restrictions. Our backend uses Python and 2 Food APIs (Food Essentials USDA) to request ingredient lists and food categories that are checked against the user's inputted dietary restrictions.

### Motivation

Our goal was to create an application that people could use on a daily basis, and since food is an essential part of everyone's lives, we found it was the perfect opportunity to use Google Action to develop something that would be easy-to-use and personalized. Many people around us have dietary restrictions, and find it difficult to look up whether certain foods conform to those restrictions, and we wanted to provide an easy way for people to do that, while also taking this as an opportunity to explore new frameworks and platforms such as the Google Home.

### Coming Soon!
While we haven't submitted out Google Action for review by the end of UofTHacks2018, we are expecting to have it reviewed and hopefully released very soon!
